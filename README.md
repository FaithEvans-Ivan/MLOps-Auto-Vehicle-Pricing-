Streamlining Auto Vehicle Pricing through MLOps

This project will design and implement an MLOps pipeline that automates the pricing workflow. This pipeline will encompass data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, model building, training, evaluation, and registration with CI/CD capabilities to ensure continuous integration and delivery
